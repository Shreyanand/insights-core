    "# Red Hat Insights Core Tutorial\n",
    "Insights Core is a framework for collecting and processing data on systems in a standard way. The general idea is to collect data from files or commands, convert each output to a python object with an appropriate interface, optionally compose several of those objects into others to unify their APIs or provide a friendlier one, and finally to write policies that operate on any of those components.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't *have* to use all of the features Insights Core provides. You can use it as a simple file and command collector. But the real power comes from the catalogues of built-in components that go beyond simple data collection to expose proper objects to your own extensions of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish all of this, Insights Core uses an internal dependency resolution engine. Components in the form of class or function definitions describe dependencies on other components with decorators, and the complete dependency graphs can be executed once all components you care about have been loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introduction to the dependency resolution system followed by a tour of the standard components Insights Core provides."
